# jotai-advanced-forms

A powerful, type-safe, and composable form state management library for React, built on top of [Jotai](https://jotai.org/). It provides advanced form primitives, validation, and dynamic field management, all with a minimal and ergonomic API.

- **Type-safe**: Leverages TypeScript for strong typing of form state and validation.
- **Composable**: Use atoms and atom families to build complex, dynamic forms.
- **Validation**: Built-in validation support for fields and field families.
- **Dynamic fields**: Add or remove fields on the fly (e.g., for arrays of inputs).

## Why jotai-advanced-forms?

- Integrates seamlessly with Jotai's atom-based state model.
- No additional context providers - just Jotai Atoms and React Hooks.
- Fine-grained control over form state, errors, and validation.
